        "whatIsIt": "We have capacity to conduct accelerated bearing failure testing on an industrial pump to track the signal degradation of different sensors.",
        "whatEquipmentsAreInvolved": "UWA has a Goulds 3196MTX pump in a simple loop system that generates around 10m of head at full flow. The pump is fitted with a 1500W motor, which rotates the shaft at 1432 RPM. The pump has two bearings installed on the driving shaft, a 6309 radial bearing and 5309 thrust bearing. Both of these bearings measure 100mm in diameter (outer). \n The pump is located in a workshop, with capacity for drainage and ease in disassembling the pump.The installation of new bearings on the pump can be done exclusively at the UWA campus, requiring a technician or fitter to do the bearing installation.",
        "whatEquipmentsAreInvolvedImage": "/img/accelerated-life-testing/accelerated-bearing-failure-testing/equipment.jpg",
        "methodology": "Two different tests have been created for this pump based on the most common failure causes of pumps, failure through lubrication contamination. This was achieved by packing two different greases into the same bearing (Test 1) and mixing dirt sourced from the Pilbara (<70 micrometers) with grease. Both of these tests have proven results of creating failure profiles on the bearing, validated using temperature probes and piezoelectric accelerometers.\nThere is scope to perform the following tests:<ul><li>shaft misalignment</li><li>dirt / metal / quarts contamination</li><li>seeded defects in bearing</li><li>mixing greases</li></ul>",
        "methodologyImage": "/img/accelerated-life-testing/accelerated-bearing-failure-testing/methodology.jpg",
        "limitations": "The bearing changeout process can take some time due to needing an external contractor to strip the pump and replace the bearings.\nThe pump is located in a shared workspace, and cannot be left unsupervised during testing.\nUsing a pump for bearing replacements can take more time due to seal breakages and needing to order replacement parts.",

        "whatIsIt": "The Living Lab has the capacity to perform accelerated UV degradation testing. UV degradation is a major challenge to the reliability of equipment in a variety of environments, from the harsh Australian outback to the perpetual daylight of the polar regions, and affects all materials. ",
        "whatEquipmentsAreInvolved": "The Living Lab has access to a xenon arc lamp Atlas Suntest CPS+ accelerated weathering unit with daylight filters capable of producing UV radiation with a frequency between 300-800nm and a maximum intensity of 765W/㎡. The unit is located in a lab on UWA campus and can be set up to perform tests over long periods to expose equipment to sustained, elevated levels of UV radiation.",
        "whatEquipmentsAreInvolvedImage": "/img/accelerated-life-testing/uv-testing/equipment.jpg",
        "methodology": "The typical process for accelerated UV weathering testing employed by the Living Lab is as follows:<ul><li>Pre-test functional test and visual inspection of one unit</li><li>Expose the unit for a given time period at an agreed radiation level.  Rotate the unit by 180° halfway through the agreed testing period.</li><li>Functional test and visual inspection halfway through testing period.</li><li>Post-test functional test and visual inspection.</li><li>Assessment, if necessary, repetition of the test.</li></ul>",
        "methodologyImage": "/img/accelerated-life-testing/uv-testing/methodology.png",
        "limitations": "When designing the UV exposure testing scheme the Living Lab team consulted ISO 4892-1 Plastics — Methods of exposure to laboratory light sources — Part 1: General guidance and ISO 4892-2 Plastics — Methods of exposure to laboratory light sources — Part 2: Xenon-arc lamps. \nISO 4892-1 4.2.3 describes an important limitation of accelerated UV testing that “Even though it is very tempting, it is invalid to assign to all materials a “general acceleration factor” relating “x” hours or megajoules of radiant exposure in an artificial accelerated weathering or artificial accelerated irradiation exposure to “y” months or years of actual exposure”.\nThere will be differences in relative spectral irradiance between the Atlas light source and solar radiation, in the temperature and irradiance levels experienced by the test unit and those deployed in the field. However, the testing scheme devised by the Living Lab provides a good first indicator of whether or not a piece of equipment is ready for further testing and/or site trials. ",

The probes are then placed near the device. Changes to the operation of the device must then be monitored. Changes such as the device switching off, changing states, loss of memory, etc. If none of these occur, then the device passes. Failing one or more of these does not mean the device automatically fails. Depending on the standard used as long as the device has no permanent damage or loss of data then the device will normally pass with just a lower grade\nWarning: Some frequencies are illegal to be emitted. Before completing this test please check if the frequency being used is allowed. If not, then the test must be performed in an electrically shielded room.",

        "limitations": "The standards for EMC testing are all defined in the far-field. The probes we have are near-field probes and hence we cannot measure the far field radiation. Additionally, there is no way to convert between far field and near field. The test we do will indicate which components are emitting large amounts of radiation, but we will not be able to determine if a device complies with a specific standard or not.",
